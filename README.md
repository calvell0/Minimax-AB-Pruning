# TicTacToeBot

This project was focused on implementation of minimax algorithm alone and using alpha-beta pruning in the form of a tic-tac-toe AI. The agorithm was implemented on top of some given skeleton code. My code can be found in the getNextMove() method of the GameAI class and in all methods besides calculateUtility() in the MiniMax class.
